exercises: 0
questions:
- "How are electrons treated in CMS OpenData?"
objectives:
- "Learn electron member functions for common track-based quantities"
- "Bookmark informational web pages for electrons"
- "Learn member functions for identification and isolation of electrons"
- "Learn member functions for electron detector-related quantities"
keypoints:
- "Quantities such as impact parameters and charge have common member functions."
- "Physics objects in CMS are reconstructed from detector signals and are never 100% certain!"
- "Identification and isolation algorithms are important for reducing fake objects."
- "Member functions for these algorithms are documented on public TWiki pages."
